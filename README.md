##Sampling variability:

how estimates(mean,meadian,standaerd deviation..)vary from one sample to another

sample distribution =! sampling distribution(distribution of mean1,mean2,mean3......)


>#we call the standard deviation of sample means (sampling distribution) the **standard error**
 While the standard error uses statistics (sample data) standard deviations use parameters (population data)
 The SE tells you how far your sample statistic (like the sample mean) deviates from the actual population mean. The larger your sample size, the smaller the SE. In other words, the larger your sample size, the closer your sample mean is to the actual population mean.
 
 SE=mean/sqrt of n.o of o.b in sample
 
# confidence interval 
A plausible range of values for the population parameter is called a **confidence interval**

>if we report a point estimate, we probably won't hit exact population paramrter (eg:BP,using a net instead of a stick)
# Critical value
A critical value is a line on a graph that splits the graph into sections. One or two of the sections is the “rejection region“; if your test value falls into that region, then you reject the null hypothesis.
# Z score 
how far from mean value a datapoint eg:2sd away 1sd away..Z score=1.96 when the datapoint is 2sd away from center
# P value
probablity of observed or more extreme outcome given the null hypothesis is true

probablity of alternative hypothesis is true given the null hypothesis is true
p<0.05(significance value)(alpha)

The P-value indicates how likely it is that the observed trend happened by chance, or is indeed reliable. The smaller the P-value, the more likely it is that the conclusions that you would draw from looking at this line are indeed reliable and something that you should trust. Now the convention is that you should only trust trend lines with P-values that are less than either 0.05, or 0.01. Now when you're using a P-value of 0.05, that means that there's a false positive rate of 5% or less. If you're using a P-value of 0.01, that means there is a false positive rate of 1% or less. So that gives you an idea of the things that you should consider important for your analysis. Now, this particular line has a P-value of 0.07. So one way to decide whether or not this effect is important for your analysis would be to say well, it's not under 0.05,
